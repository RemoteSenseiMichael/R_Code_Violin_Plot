# R Code: Violin Plot

This code, writtin in the R programming language, is for creating a violin plot from samples of remote sensing variables. The plot is created using the ggplot2 library in R. Similar to a boxplot, but with the addition of a rotated kernel density plot on both sides, a violin plot is a statistical graphic for comparing distributions.

In the example here, the distribution of 8 remote sensing variables in relation to deep and shallow permafrost depth classes is presented.
